# 1: Write a Python program to implement a class named BookStore with the following specifications:
# The class should contain two instance variables:
# Name (Book Name)
# Author (Book Author)
# The class should contain one class variable:
# NoOfBooks (initialize it to 0)
# Define a constructor (init) that accepts Name and Author and initializes instance variables.
# Inside the constructor, increment the class variable NoOf Books by 1 whenever a new object is created.
# Implement an instance method:
# Display() should display book details in the format:
# <BookName> by <Author>. No of books: <NoOfBooks>
# Example usage:
# Obj1 BookStore ("Linux System Programming", "Robert Love")
# Objl. Display() # Linux System Programming by Robert Love. No of
# books: 1
# Obj2 BookStore ("C Programming", "Dennis Ritchie")
# Obj2.Display() # C Programming by Dennis Ritchie. No of books: 2

class BookStore:
    NoOfBooks=0

    def __init__(self,N,A):
        self.Name=N
        self.Author=A
        BookStore.NoOfBooks=BookStore.NoOfBooks+1
        
    def Display(self):
        
        print(self.Name,"by",self.Author,"No of books:",BookStore.NoOfBooks)

Obj1=BookStore("Linux System Programming", "Robert Love")
Obj1.Display()

Obj2=BookStore ("C Programming", "Dennis Ritchie")
Obj2.Display()
